# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 25

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
```shell
javac org/json/*.java
```

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
```shell
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
```

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
```shell
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
```

*Test file contents*

```java
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo);
    }
}
```

*Execute the Test file*
```shell 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
```

*Expected output*

```json
{"abc":"def"}
```

 
**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```shell
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```shell
gradlew clean build test
```

*Optional* Execute the test suite in strict mode with Gradlew:

```shell
gradlew testWithStrictMode
```

*Optional* Execute the test suite in strict mode with Maven:

```shell
mvn test -P test-strict-mode 
```
